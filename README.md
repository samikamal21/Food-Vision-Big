# Food-Vision-Big
A CNN model which utilizes mixed preicison training was used to classify a bunch of different images of food. 

This project has the goal of beating [DeepFood](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304163308_DeepFood_Deep_Learning-Based_Food_Image_Recognition_for_Computer-Aided_Dietary_Assessment), a 2016 paper which used a Convolutional Neural Network trained for 2-3 days to achieve 77.4% top-1 accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used in the model can be found here: https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/
